# ArrayCipher

In this project, you will use your new-found knowledge of **arrays** and **loops** to build a
(really low quality) _Enigma Machine_ that will encode or decode a secret message. This poject
will use a _simple substitution cipher_.

## Simple Substitution Cipher

Every cipher has three components:
1. _Plaintext_: The actual secret message to be encoded into a cipher.
2. _Ciphertext_: The plaintext written in some code.
3. _Key_: The mechanism for encoding/decoding the plaintext into the cipher text and vice-versa.

In the simple substitution cipher, each letter is systematically swapped out for another letter.
For example:

| Plaintext | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ciphertext|

## Project Description

Write a program called `Crypto.java` that takes a String as a command line argument and prints
out a simple substitution cipher
